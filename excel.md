# 📊 Sales Data Analysis - Excel Project

## 📝 Overview
This is my first data analysis project using **Excel**.  
The goal was to practice **data cleaning** and **basic sales analysis** using pivot tables and charts.

## 🔧 Steps I Followed
1. Removed duplicates to avoid double-counted sales.
2. Checked and validated data types:
   - Dates in `Order Date`
   - Numeric values in `Quantity`, `Sales`, and `Profit`
3. Looked for missing values and corrected errors where possible.
4. Created helper columns (Month, Year) for time analysis.
5. Built pivot tables and charts to analyze:
   - 📈 Sales quantity per month  
   - 🏆 Top 5 best-selling products  
   - 💰 Revenue by category  

## 📂 Files
- **`Sales Data Analysis`** → Cleaned dataset with different analysis sheets:
  - `per months` → sales summarized by month  
  - `per products` → sales summarized by product  
  - `per revenue` → revenue analysis  

## 🚀 Next Steps
I will continue this project by:
- Importing the **raw dataset** into SQL Server.
- Practicing data cleaning with SQL queries.
- Comparing results between **Excel and SQL**.
- Expanding the project to Python for visualization.
